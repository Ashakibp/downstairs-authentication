# Downstairs Authentication Script

API Keys and phone numbers must be held in a json in the same directory.

## Why did I make this?

So pretty much  in my building, when I get "buzzed", it forwards the called to my phone, and I can press 9 to buzz them in.
This is incredibly  annoying. I found a module called twillio that allows my program to recieve call/text
 messages and send them out as well so I decided to write a program that handles the calls.
 
 ### Features
 
- Limited open: Allows me to set the door to open for a fixed number of entrances
- Stay open: Leave the door open (buzz as soon as called) until told to stop
- Password: allows me to have a password on the line, and change it via text message whenever I please. 

I plan on also putting a scheduler to leave it open for specific hours in the future.

Feel free to use this script in any way you please, and ask me for any details!
